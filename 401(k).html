                        further research on 401(k)s to help you determine whether it is.

                        <br>
                        In previous articles we discussed retirement accounts such as the Roth IRA and the traditional IRA. In this article, we will be discussing 401(k) accounts which is very similar to the traditional IRA however has a few features which differentiates it.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Lets first discuss the similarities which a 401(k) and traditional IRA possess.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In both types of accounts, you deposit a part of your income without being taxed and you can grow the initial amount through invesments, larger deposits can be made after the age of 50. You can then withdraw from the account when you turn 59 and a half however you will have to pay income tax on total disursals which is basically the sum of the principal amount you had deposted and the earnings you make through investments. If you do not start withdrawing some of your money before the age of 70.5 then you will be penalized and if you withdraw before the age of 59 and a half then you will have to pay taxes and a penalty.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Now you may be wondering what even makes a 401(k) different to a traditional IRA. Here are some unique features that a 401(k) has compared to the traditional IRA.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>- 401(k)s place higher limits on how much you can deposit. For example, in 2010 it was $16,500 which is substantially higher than the traditional IRA limit which was $5000, this is one of the pros of the 401(k).</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>- 401(k)s are organized by your employer so they have the ability to specify which investments you can make and some employers may even match the amount you deposit so they could put in a dollar for every dollar you deposit. However, your employer may have a period which you have to work for before you can redeem the money they contribute, this is called a vesting period.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>- Some employers offer a Roth 401k, allowing you to contribute after-tax dollars and take it out tax-free during retirement.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>- One advantage of the traditional IRA over the 401(k) is that you have more flexibility when it comes to investments. If you find the number of investment choices offered by your employer too restrictive, then you could check if they offer a self-directed 401(k) with more investment choices.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>- Another disadvantage of the 401(k) is the additional fees that some providers may charge, these aren't very obvious so it could be good idea to discuss them with your plan administrator or use an online 401(k) fee analyzer.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If a 401(k) is organized by your company, what can you do with it when moving to a new company? You have a few choices.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>- You could keep the money at your old companies 401(k) program if they're more flexible in terms of what you can invest in.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>- You could move the company to your new companies 401(k) program is they have a better, more flexible program. You could also just do this to keep all your money in one account instead of having multiple 401(k)s to make life a bit easier.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>- You can move the money to an IRA if you want more flexibility in terms of investment choices.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>- The last choice you have is to move the money and put it in a bank but then you would have to pay taxes and penalties if you withdraw before the age of 59.5.</li>
                        </ul>
