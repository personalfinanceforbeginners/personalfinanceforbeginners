                        Exchange traded funds or ETFs are a type of investment fund which trade like stocks. Like other types of funds such as the mutual fund, ETFs collect money from various investors and distribute them into various investments such as stocks, bonds and other securities.

                        There are many types of ETFs such as those which invest in a variety of stocks and bonds, some ETFs track the performance of stock indices like the S&P 500 and some ETFs replicate the performance of a market sector such as the pharmaceutical sector. ETFs can be a good option for an invester wanting to diversify their portfolio without having to analyze individual stocks as they can have a stake in multiple investments just by purchasing a single ETF however some ETFs offer less diversification than others for instance ETFs tracking specific market sectors tend to be less diversified.

                        Cons of ETFs:
                        <ul>
                            <li>- ETFs are traded on a stock exchange and they're traded like stocks so they usually incur commissions and other related fees.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>- Similar to stocks, ETFs can be traded at any time of the trading day but not all ETFs are widely traded which can make it harder to fill orders.</li>
                            <br>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        Pros of ETFs:
                        <ul>
                            <li>- ETFs have lower minimum investments than mutual funds as investors can just purchase a single ETF share.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>- ETFs are not actively managed like other types of funds such as mutual funds so they tend to have lower management fees.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>

                        How can an investor achieve positive returns by investing in an ETF?
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Rising ETF Price: An increase in the value of the ETF usually means an increased price as well so investors can make money by buying ETFs at lower prices and selling at a higher price.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>- Dividends: Dividends are a portion of a funds earnings and capital gains which they might distribute among shareholders, not all ETFs pay dividends as many of them reinvest earnings back into the funds investments.</li>
