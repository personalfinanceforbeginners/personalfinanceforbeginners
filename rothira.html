                        In a previous article, we discussed what individual retirement accounts are and delved into the basics of the traditional IRA. In this article, we will discuss what a Roth IRA is and what makes it different from a traditional IRA.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        What is an IRA? An IRA is an individual retirement account which allow you to save up for retirement and incentivize you to do so with the way they're structured and the features they possess.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        So what is a Roth IRA? A Roth IRA is a type of IRA which has a few details which make it different from the traditional IRA. One feature of the Roth IRA which differentiates it is the fact that taxes are not deferred like they are in a traditional IRA, you are taxed on the money which you put into the account. However, you are not taxed when withdrawing money after the age of 59 and a half from the Roth IRA unlike the traditional IRA.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Another advantage of the Roth IRA is that it offers more flexibility in terms on early withdrawal, in a traditional IRA, you have to pay a penalty as well taxes however when you withdraw money from a Roth IRA at an early date, you don't pay taxes or penalty on the principal amount you had deposited. If the withdrawal is non qualified, you are only penalized and taxed on the earnings, not the principal amount.
                        <br>
                        <br>The final advantage of the Roth IRA which we will be discussing is that there are no RMD or required minimum distributions. In the traditional IRA, you have to start withdrawing a minimum amount out of your IRA once you turn 72, however this is not the case in the Roth IRA. You can keep the money in your account as long as you are alive which allows it to grow more.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        So, to summarize, the Roth IRA is a unique type of IRA which offers the advantages of having more flexibility when it comes to early withdrawals as well as the fact that you are not taxed when withdrawing the money from the account.
