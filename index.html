                    <p>Welcome! This website was created to reflect what I was learning about personal finance and help other beginners who want to learn about it too. The site covers topics primarily on saving, budgeting, investing and retirement with articles on topics such as stocks, mutual funds and IRAs. If you want to start learning about the basics of personal finance, this website may be a good choice for you, you can start off by heading to the learn tab and clicking on any one of the modules which interest you. Once you click, it should take you to a list of all the articles in that section. I'd recommend going in numerical order however you should still be able to understand most of the content even if you don't do so. I hope you find this website informative and not too boring, enjoy!</p>
