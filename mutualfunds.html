                        In this article, we will be discussing all about mutual funds. What they are, what are the pros of mutual funds, the risks that come with them, how one can go about investing in a mutual fund and two different types of mutual funds.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Lets first discuss what a mutual fund is. A mutual fund is basically a collection of investments, when you purchase a share in a mutual fund, you have a stake in a small portions of investments in that fund.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Why might one invest in a mutual fund? Here are few of the benefits of a mutual fund-
                        <ul>
                            <br>
                            <li>- Mutual funds allow you to diversify your investment portfolio without taking the time to analyze multiple individual stocks. Diversification is important for the reduction of risk as when your portfolio is spread across multiple sectors or company, poorly performing investments in certain sectors or companies wont have as much of a drastic impact.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>- Mutual funds are funds actively managed by a fund manager or multiple fund managers who are financial professionals. Their aim to maximize returns for investors utilizing financial analysis and professional expertise.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>- Mutual funds allow investors to participate in a variety of investments as there are different mutual funds for different kinds of investments, for instance equity funds buy stocks, fixed income funds buy bonds and balance funds buy both. Some funds have different objectives with regards to growth, some invest in riskier stocks while others look for more stable stocks.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        However like most investments, mutual funds come with their risks and disadvantages.
                        <br>
                        <br>- A skilled fund manager could achieve high returns for investors but there is no guarantee of high returns. If a manager takes decisions that dont pay off then investors might not earn the returns they were hoping for and even if the fund performs poorly, the fund manager still receives a management fee which is paid from fund assets, further reducing investors returns. The price of mutual funds are updated at the end of the trading day.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        - There are also a couple other possible fees associated with mutual funds such as transaction fees and sales loads which is a charge incurred as a result of purchase or sale of shares. Some funds may charge an additional sales load if shares are sold within a specific time period.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        How can one go about investing in a mutual fund and make money from them?
                        In order to find the right mutual fund for your needs, you can use online mutual fund searches as well as ratings allocated by 3rd party organizations to choose a mutual fund that suit your goals. Once you find a mutual fund which seems suitable, you can do a bit more research on it by reviewing the fund's prospectus which is a document containing information about the fund such as its fees, charges, minimum investment amount, performance history and the risks. Once you finish this research, lets say hypothetically, you decide that the fund suits you and you purchase shares of the mutual fund.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        How can you make money? Now that in this hypothetical scenario, you have bought shares of a mutual fund, you can make money through appreciation or dividend payments. Appreciation is when the fund's asset's value increases, this usually also results in an increase of the value of the fund's shares. If this happens to your share, you can sell it for a return higher than the amount you purchased it for. Dividend payments refer to a portion of a mutual fund's earnings which they may distribute among shareholders.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In this next section of the article, we will be discussing two categories of mutual funds which are open-ended mutual funds and closed-end mutual funds.
                        <ol>
                            <br>
                            <li> Open-Ended Mutual Funds: Lets say X corporation starts an open-ended mutual fund consisting of 20 shares and they register it with the SEC, they can now start soliciting funds from the public by marketing their mutual fund. After some time. they find 20 investors who each purchase a share of the mutual fund, after a year, the mutual fund hasn't performed well so an investor wants to sell their share. They can do this by asking X corporation to buy back their share for the Net Average Value/Share which is basically the total value of all the shares combined divided by the number of shares. This causes the NAV of the fund to reduce as one of the shares has been removed but the NAV/share remains the same. The next year, the fund performs better and an investor wants to purchase a share of the mutual fund so X corporation decides to make another share and sell it to the investor, causing the NAV to increase.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                Closed-End Mutual Funds: Now lets consider the 2 scenarios discussed above if X corporation had started a closed-end mutual fund, X corporation would not be able to remove and add shares so the number of shares remain fixed. If an investor wanted to sell their share, they would have to sell it to someone else as the corporation cannot buy it back.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
