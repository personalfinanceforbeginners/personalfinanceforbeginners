                        What is an emergency savings fund? Well, the name speaks for itself. It is a fund which comes handy during an emergency. For example, if your houses ceiling broke and needed urgent repairs then you would take some money out of the fund to fix it or if you were ill for a long period then you could use the fund to pay your monthly expenses even if you were unable to bring in your usual monthly income. This article lists the main expenses you need to account for while creating your emergency savings fund as well as the options for storing it.

                        Your major costs should be covered for six to nine months by your emergency funds. If it seems like a difficult task, it would be a good idea to break it up into smaller goals, such as 1 month, 2 months, etc. The following list includes some of the expenses you might want to take into account as you decide how much to set aside. Expenses vary from person to person, but these are some common ones to start with.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Housing: Ensure that you have enough for utilities, rent, property taxes and home repairs just in case.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Transportation: Keep fuel, repairs and your regular maintenance in mind. If you use public transport, then you should account for that too.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Insurance: Consider medical insurance, life insurance, car insurance, house insurance, any insurance that you might be paying for.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Loans: Account for your mortgages, car loans or any loan in general.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Debt Repayment: Making credit and debt payments in time is key to ensure that your credit score does not suffer. In general, try to take steps to minimize your debt now so you don't have that burden if you face financial challenges in the future.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Food: Analyze your previous months food costs and make an estimate as to how much you might have to save.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Personal expenses: Shaving gel, toilet paper, haircuts etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        How can one start assembling an emergency fund?

                        Where can you store these funds?
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Regular savings account: A basic account which is a good choice to start with and allows you access your money whenever you want.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Money market account: Good option for higher interest rates while still being easy to access. These accounts usually offer a better return than a regular savings account but may require a higher minimum balance to avoid fees.</li>
                        </ul>
