                        In this article we will be discussing what stocks are, how they work and the basics of how they are valued.

                        So what are stocks? A stock is basically a portion of a company, when you purchase a stock, you're buying a part of the company and you have a claim on its future earnings.

                        <br>
                        So how do stocks work? Lets say there is a company which sells smartphones and they're really popular so they want to expand in order to sell more smartphones to the rest of the world. In order to do this, they would need to acquire money. There are two primary ways they can go about doing it, they can either take out a loan and consequently a lot of debt or they can issue stocks which is also known as public. The advantage of going public is that they dont take on debt and instead sell shares and claims on future earnings to investors.

                        <br>
                        When investing in stocks, you ideally want to buy when the price is low and sell when the price is high however stocks don't always go up and can keep fluctuating so stocks are a relatively risky investment. Then why do people keep coming back to stocks? Well, stocks may hold more risk than investing a mutual fund but stocks also offer the potential of higher returns.

                        How are stocks valued? In order to understand how stocks are valued, we need to first understand a few key terms. Assets are something which give a company future benefits like cash, machinery etc. and liabilities are benefits that that have to give to another organization in the future like a loan they have taken. If all the assets of a company were sold and all the liabilities had to be paid off, whatever money is left is considered the owner's equity. In a stock market, shares of the company's equity are bought and sold so lets say a compant has $10,000,000 in equity and they have 1,000,000 shares then each share would be worth $10
