                        In this article, we will be discussing what bonds are, how they work and a few of the risks which come along with bonds.

                        A bond is basically a loan which investors give to the company and they're viewed as a less risky alternative to stocks. They're also sometimes used to diversify a stock portfolio.

                        In order to understand how bonds work, lets look at a fictional scenario. Lets say that a company wants to build a new factory and need to raise money so they issue bonds. Each bond is a loan of $2000 which is known as its face value and the company promises to pay it back in 10 years which is when it reaches maturity, they also decide to set a 5% interest rate known as a coupon rate in order to incentivize investors. If you decided to invest in the bond then you would get paid $100 every year for 10 years for 10 years and when it reaches maturity, you will receive your principal amount back. This does not apply to all bonds however, there is a type of bond known as a zero-coupon bond where you do not receive any regular payments of interest rather you get one large interest payment when the bond reaches maturity.

                        Bonds offer regular payments and return of invested amount so they're viewed as relatively stable investments however they come with their own set of risks too.

                        Default Risk: This is the risk of the possibility that issuer defaults on paying back the principal. Higher default risks usually also means that a bond has higher coupon rates, default risk is most affected by the financial stability of the issuer, this is why bonds issued by governments have lowered default risks than bonds issued by companies who can go bankrupt. There are organizations known as credit rating agencies who rank bonds to help investors understand the financial stability of bond issuers. However, these ratings are not always accurate so it is important to conduct your
                        own research too.

                        Interest Rate Risk: This is the risk of interest rates going up causing bonds you own to decrease in value if sold before reaching maturity. When interest rates rise, a higher number of investors invest in new bonds with increased interest rates so if you want to unload your bond with a lower interest rate then you would have sell your bond at a discount to attract other investors willing to purchase the bond.
