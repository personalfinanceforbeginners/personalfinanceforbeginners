                        So why do we need a budget? Well budgets help us plan how we use our money so that we do not develop bad financial habits such as overspending. This article provides a step-by-step process to create a budget.

                        <br>
                        <div class="subtitle">Step 1 - Figure out your net income:</div>
                        Identifying your income is the first stage. Next, deduct taxes, social security etc. Net income is the amount you ultimately have after these deductions.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <div class="subtitle">Step 2 - List your expenses:</div>
                        Fixed and variable expenses are the two categories of expenses you can list. The regular monthly payments
                        for your utilities and mortgage are examples of fixed expenses. However, your variable expenses, such as those for groceries and gas, change from month to month. Your monthly expenses are frequently categorized on your credit card and bank accounts. Tip: Consider allocating funds to your goals as a fixed expense that you owe to yourself.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <div class="subtitle">Step 3 - Goalsetting:</div>
                        List all of your financial goals, including short- and long-term. A short-term goal might be to save up $200 to buy a bicycle. Short-term objectives shouldn't take more than a year to complete. On the other hand, a long-term objective, like saving money to buy a house, can take years to accomplish. These goals should ideally be SMART goals, meaning they should be specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timebound.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <div class="subtitle">Step 4 - Analyze habits and make a plan:</div>
                        Using the list of expenses you created, try to project your spending over the following few months. Analyze your
                        previous spending patterns in the case of variable costs. You might discover that you're overspending in a particular category after doing this. For instance, you might realize that you could save money by cooking at home instead of dining out four days a week, which is probably unhealthy in more ways than one. From that point on, you can cut back on eating out and use the extra money to buy groceries so you can prepare healthier meals at home. The money you saved by making the switch can then be put towards your goals.
