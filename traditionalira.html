                        What is an individual retirement account? Well, an individual retirement account or IRA for short is a way you can save up for retirement in the United States of America and are structured in a way which can incentivize you to save for retirement. There are multiple different types of IRAs with slight differences between them. In this article, we will be discussing one of them which is the traditional IRA however we will also be discussing the Roth IRA in a separate article.

                        How does an IRA work? An IRA lets you deposit a certain amount of your income into an account, this amount differs by age and they keep on changing over time. In 2010, the maximum amount was $5000 for those under the age of 50 and $6000 for those over the age of 50 so if you were under the age of 50 in 2010 then you could deposit $5000 into your IRA without being taxed on it which is a short term advantage.

                        One thing you can do with the amount in your IRA is buy, sell and trade investments but you will not be able to withdraw
                        it before the age of 59 and a half without having to pay a penalty along with taxes. Another advantage of an IRA is that you wont have to pay taxes on the capital gains you may make through investing the money deposited in your IRA which can allow you to grow the amount at a quicker rate.

                        Once your age is over 60, you can withdraw the IRA without being penalized but you still have to pay taxes on it, the advantage of differing your taxes on income is that at 60 you would probably be earning less money so the tax bracket which you fall under would probably be lower than what your tax bracket might have been when you deposited the principal amount in your IRA.

                        While the traditional IRA has its advantages and may seem like a pretty good deal, there are other options out there like the Roth IRA which offers its own set of pros and cons. If you want to learn more about the Roth IRA, don't fret, we have discussed it in a separate article located in the same section of the site. See you there!
