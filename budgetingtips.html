                    <p>
                        In another article, I discussed the process of making a budget and how you can make one however it can be strenous so here are some other tips to help you manage your money.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    <div class="subtitle">1. The Envelope Method</div>
                    The envelope method is a good way to budget if you find it hard to stick to a traditional spreadsheet budget and
                    overspend more than you would like to. It involves gathering a few envelopes and allocating a use for each of them, for example if you wanted to limit the amount you spend on eating out every week to $100 then you could place a hundred dollars in an envelope and label it using a marker or however you want. Everytime you eat out in a week, you could take out money from that envelope to pay for your meal. This method can be used for various expenses you want to control.

                    <div class="subtitle">2. Automatic Payments</div>
                    Automatic payments make many different types of fixed payments easier. Most utilities companies and phone service
                    providers usually offer the option to sign up for fixed payments. In some cases, your landlord may allow you to set up automatic payments too. Automatic payments can also be made to yourself in order to make saving up for your financial goals easier.

                    <br>
                    <div class="subtitle">3. Setting Rewards</div>
                    Rewarding yourself can be a good way to prevent overspending. You can do this by setting one of your goals as a reward like dinner at your favourite restaurant or you can allocate money towards a larger goal like buying yourself the new gaming console you've wanted.

                    <div class="subtitle">4. Budgeting Software</div>
                    There are many apps out there which make it easier for you to budget, your bank may even offer an app specifically built to help you budget. Forbes Advisor recommends Mint as the best app for monitoring daily activity. It is a free app available for desktop and your phone, it helps you track your credit score, maintain a customizable budget and offers customizable alerts for upcoming bills and potential bank fees.
